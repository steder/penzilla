<h4><font color="green">Asking the user questions</font></h4>
<P>
I personally haven't spent a lot of time writing programs that prompt the user
for input.  Usually, I deal with commandline arguments are configuration files.  However, it's not unreasonable to want to query the user to figure out what they'd like to do next.  
<P>
I'm first going to look into how you prompt for input, and I'll cover file IO and commandline arguments in a couple later sections.
<h4><font color="green">Meet 'raw_input'</font></h4>

<P><font color="blue">raw_input</font> is a function that takes whatever string is passed to it and uses it as a prompt, and then waits for the user to press enter before returning.  All the text typed in between the time raw_input is called and the time when the user presses enter is the return value of <font color="blue">raw_input</font>.  

<!--Include Sourcecode-->
<ul><!--#include virtual="consoleio.py.html" --></ul>

<P>You'll hopefully notice in the above code that there is a lot of error 
checking that should really be included.  For instance, what happens if
the user inputs 0.7, -3, or whatever for the number between 1 and 7?  I'm not
sure, and neither is this program.  This is part of the reason that user input
is kind of a pain.
