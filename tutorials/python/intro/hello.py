# Intro to Python 
# THROUGH:
# The _Sacred_ Hello World Program

# At the interpreter
print "Hello World!" # Note that the "\n" is automagic after each print.

# As a function
def hello():
	print "Hello World!"
	return # This is optional, since you aren't returning anything.

# From the commandline (A one liner, immediate execution)
import os
os.popen("python -c \"print 'Hello World!'\"")
# Just python -c "print 'hello world!'" at the commandline.
