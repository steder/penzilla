##  Population Simulation in Python
##  PYTHON POPULATION SIMULATOR v0.00
##
##  Simulation Engine Object
##  engine.py
##
##  "this object generates a field/universe for our creatures
##   and distributes them.  A call to a step method timesteps
##   the entire 'civilization' of creatures once.  Behaviors
##   are defined in an list or dictionary so that many Behaviors
##   can be applied without hardcoding each case.
##
##   Currently the model follows the following rules:
##   There are 3 types of creature
##    * Carrot Dudes - Plants
##    * Swahini Girls - Cute Fuzzy Herbivores
##    * Icecream Men - Psychopathic Carnivores
##   They Move and Act According to the following rules
##    * A timestep is a day and a year is 365 Timesteps
##    * Behaviours:
##      * Lifespan
##        * Creatures have no max lifespan
##        * Only odds of continuing to live which get worse as
##          Age increases.  Essentially a newborn has a chance of
##          dying.  In fact at the extremes of age the creature
##          should have the worst chances.  Possibly in 5 day/step
##          increments.
##        * Death checks every 5 to 10 steps.
##      * Movement & Nourishment & Mating
##        * Animals Move Every Cycle/Step
##        * Plants don't move, but they do reproduce every 5/10 Steps
##          * Reproduction Produces a plant on an adjacent coordinate.
##          * If the plant can't reproduce, it's surrounded, it will
##            exhibit  some other behaviour, as yet undisclosed...???
##        * Animals Must Eat Every 2/3 Days Or Die
##          * An Herbivore Eat's Plants (essentially killing and replacing
##            the plant on that section of the environement.
##          * An Herbivore cannot move onto a carnivore
##          * A Carnivore Eat's Herbivores But leaves Plants unharmed
##        * Animals of the same type that move onto each other will mate.
##          * The odd's of mating are good.  If the creatures mate,
##            One creature becomes marked as pregnent
##            and the new creature is born the next day if there is a square
##            adjacent to 'mom'
##            else:  the newborn dies due to overcrowding
